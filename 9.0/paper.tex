\begin{abstract}
  This paper provides an overview of the new features of the finite element
  library \dealii{} version 9.0.
\end{abstract}


\section{Overview}

\dealii{} version 9.0.0 was released April X, 2018. This paper provides an
overview of the new features of this major release and serves as a citable
reference for the \dealii{} software library version 9.0. \dealii{} is an
object-oriented finite element library used around the world in the
development of finite element solvers. It is available for free under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) from the \dealii{} homepage at
\url{http://www.dealii.org/}.

The major changes of this release are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Manifold smoothing: The manifold smoothing algorithms applied in the
  Triangulation class and MappingQGeneric have been changed from the old
  Laplace-style smoothing to a transfinite interpolation that linearly
  blends between the descriptions on the faces around a cell. The old
  transformation introduced boundary layers inside cells that prevented
  convergence rates from exceeding 3.5 in the global L2 errors on typical
  settings. This change also considerably improves mesh quality on settings
  where curved descriptions are only applied to the boundary rather than
  the whole volume.

\item
  C++11 is now required and used in many places. For performance reason,
  move semantics is used when possible and in many places, \texttt{emplace\_back} 
  replaces \texttt{push\_back()}. C-style raw pointers have been replaced by
  \texttt{shared\_ptr} and \texttt{unique\_ptr} to avoid the risk of memory leak.
  Private constructors have been removed and instead were delete. clang-tidy is
  now being used to ensure the quality of the code.

\item
  Improved support for LinearOperator (Trilinos payload, Schur complement,
  iterative inverse), removal of old wrapper classes

\item
  Significant extension of matrix-free capabilities, including support for face integrals in discontinuous Galerkin schemes, a new Hermite-like polynomial basis adapted to face integrals that involve derivatives of shape functions, and several performance enhancements

\item
  Support for GPU

\item
  Increased support for dense solvers (LAPACK changes and new ScaLAPACK
  interface).

\item
  A dedicated sundials module has been created to provide support for the
  SUNDIALS library. SUNDIALS is a SUite of Nonlinear and
  DIfferential/ALgebraic equations Solvers. ARKode, IDA, and KINSOL are
  supported. ARKode is a solver library that provides adaptive-step time
  integration. IDA is a package for the solution of differential-algebraic
  equations systems in the form $F(t,y,y')=0$. KINSOL is solver for nonlinear
  algebraic systems.

\item 
  A dedicated optimization/rol module has been created to provide support for
  the Rapid Optimization Library (ROL). ROL is a package for large-scale
  optimization.

\item
  A dedicated particles module has been created to provide support for the
  storage of particles and their properties. This module provides a base class
  \texttt{Particles} which represents a particle with position, an ID number and
  a variable number of properties. It also provides a \texttt{ParticleHandler}
  class that manages the storage and handling of particles. This class
  distributes the particles in distributed domains (these are the only domains
  supported by this class so far)

\item
  A dedicated differentiation module has been created to provide support for
  automatic and symbolic differentiation. Automatic differentiation is a set of
  technique to evaluate the derivatives of a function defined by a compute
  program. Currently the Adol-C and Sacado libraries are supported through a
  unified interface. In practice, this support means that Adol-c and Sacado
  data types can be used in the \texttt{FEValues} and \texttt{FEValuesViews}
  to represent degree-of-freedom values.

\item
  Support for complex-valued vectors is now at the same level as real-valued
  vectors.

\item
  Support for the nanoflann library. nanoflann is a library for building
  KD-trees of datasets and for the fast querying of closest neighbors in
  KD-trees. nanoflann is used to speed up the search of the p nearest neighbors
  of a given point, or searching the points that fall within a radius of a
  target point.

\item
  Support for the Open Asset Import Library (Assimp). Assimp can be used to read
  about 40 different 3D graphics formats. A subset of these formats can be used
  to generate two-dimensional meshes possibly embedded in a three-dimensional
  space.

\item
  Initial support for Gmsh

\item
  Initial support for generalized support points: Internal interpolation
  rewritten (support for $H(\text{curl})$ and $H(\text{div})$ conforming
  elements).

\item New python tutorial program tutorial-1; as well as
  updates to step-37. In addition, the separate code
  gallery of \dealii{} has gained a number of new entries.

  \item More than 330 other features and bugfixes.
\end{itemize}
The more important ones of these changes will be detailed in the
following section.  Information on how to cite \dealii{} is provided
in Section \ref{sec:cite}.



\section{Significant changes to the library}

This release of \dealii{} contains a number of large and significant changes
that will be discussed in the following sections. It of course also contains a
vast number of smaller changes and added functionality; the details of these
can be found
\href{https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_8_5_and_9_0.html}{
in the file that lists all changes for this release}, see \cite{changes90}.
(The file is also linked to from the web site of each release as well as
the release announcement.)


\subsection{Feature 1}

\subsection{Feature 2}


\subsection{New and updated tutorial programs}
\marginpar{OLD}
In addition to the updated tutorial programs mentioned in the previous
section, this release of \dealii{} includes three new tutorials TODO: old:
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\bf step-55} explains how to solve the Stokes
 equations efficiently in parallel. It is a good introduction to solving
 systems of PDEs in parallel, discusses optimal block
 preconditioners, and demonstrates other aspects like error computation.
 Inverses of individual blocks of the linear system are approximated with an algebraic
 multigrid preconditioner.

 \item {\bf step-56} shows how to apply geometric multigrid
 preconditioners on a subset of a system of PDEs. The problem solved here is the
 Stokes equations, like in step-55.

 \item {\bf step-57} solves the stationary Navier-Stokes equations.
 The nonlinear system is solved using Newton's method on a sequence of adaptively refined
 grids. The preconditioner is again built on a block factorization of the saddle point
 system like in step-55 and step-56, but the non-symmetric terms stemming from the
 nonlinear convective part requires more sophisticated solvers. The benchmark problem,
 flow in the 2d lid-driven cavity, requires a continuation method for high Reynolds
 numbers.
 \end{itemize}

In addition to tutorials, \dealii{} has a separate ``code gallery'' that
consists of programs shared by users as examples of what can be
done with \dealii{}. While not part of the release process, it is nonetheless
worth mentioning that the set of new programs since the last release covers
the following topics:
\marginpar{OLD}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Quasi-static quasi-incompressible visco-elastic material behavior;
    \item Multiphase Navier-Stokes flow;
    \item The evolution of global-scale topography on planetary bodies;
    \item Goal-oriented elastoplasticity.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{New non-standard quadrature rules}

\begin{itemize}
\item QSimplex
\item QDuffy
\item QTrianglePolar
\item QSplit
\end{itemize}

Mostly used for BEM problems.

\subsection{Incompatible changes}

\marginpar{OLD}
The 9.0 release includes around XYZ
\href{https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_8_5_and_9_0.html}{
incompatible changes}; see \cite{changes90}. The majority of these changes
should not be visible to typical user codes; some remove previously
deprecated classes and functions, and the majority change internal
interfaces that are not usually used in external applications. However, three
incompatible changes are worth mentioning:
\begin{itemize}
  \item High-order Lagrange elements, both continuous \verb!FE_Q! and
    discontinuous \verb!FE_DGQ! types, now use the nodal points of the
    Gauss-Lobatto quadrature formula as support points by default, rather than the
    previous equidistant ones. For cubic polynomials and higher, the point
    distribution has thus changed and, consequently, the entries in
    solution vectors will be different compared to previous
    versions of \dealii{}. Note, however, that using the Gauss-Lobatto points as nodal
    points results in a much more stable interpolation, including better
    iteration counts in most iterative solvers.
  \item
    The library no longer instantiates template classes with \texttt{long
    double}. These were rarely used, but took up a significant
    fraction of compile and link time, as well as library
    size. Application programs can, however, still instantiate all
    template classes with \texttt{long
    double} as long as they include the corresponding \texttt{.templates.h}
    header files.
  \item
    The \texttt{ParameterGUI} has been moved to a separate repository.
\end{itemize}



\section{How to cite \dealii{}}\label{sec:cite}

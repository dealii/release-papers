Dear Maxim Olshanskii,

Attached please find a copy of our manuscript entitled "The deal.II Library, Version 9.7" for submission to the Journal of Numerical Mathematics. Thank you for considering this year's version for publication!

Please note that the manuscriptcentral.com website only allows adding up to seven authors, so I was only able to add the first seven (out of 16). For that reason I was also unable to use the recommended latex template.

Please let me know if you have any questions! 

Thank you,
Timo Heister

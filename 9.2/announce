Version 9.2.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:

  - Six new tutorial programs: step-47 solves the biharmonic equation;
    step-50 demonstrates algebraic and geometric multigrid methods for
    large, parallel computations on adaptively refined meshes, and
    compares matrix-based and matrix-free implementations; step-58
    solves the nonlinear Schroedinger equation; step-65 illustrates
    working with complex geometries and curved domains; step-67 and
    step-69 implementing different approaches for the Euler equations
    in compressible gas dynamics.

  - Substantial improvements to the Python interfaces, including
    Jupyter versions of the step-49 and step-53 tutorial program.

  - A new triangulation class (parallel::fullydistributed::Triangulation)
    that completely distributes a triangulation, rather than keeping
    the coarse mesh available on all processors.

  - The DataOut and related classes now fully support outputting
    complex-valued solution vectors, including complex-valued vector
    and tensor fields.

  - A number of fixes throughout the library for problems with more
    than 2^32 (=4 billion) unknowns.

  - Improvements to the support for particle based methods as well as
    to parallel hp-adaptive finite element methods.

  - More than 320 other new features, improvements, and bugfixes.
